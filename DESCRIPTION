Description: Perform association analysis of bivariate survival data based on copula models.
 Two different ways to estimate the association parameter in copula models are implemented.
 A goodness-of-fit test for a given copula model is implemented.
 See Emura, Lin and Wang (2010) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2010.03.013> for details.
 A more general reference for the copula-based analysis of bivariate survival data is
